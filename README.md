📚 Empire Bookstore Information System
This repository contains the database project developed for the ICT450 - Database Design and Development course. The project aims to solve key operational issues faced by Empire Bookstore by implementing a comprehensive information system for handling book orders, customer data, and sales tracking.

🔍 Project Overview
The Empire Bookstore Information System was developed in response to challenges faced by a growing book retail business. With the rise in customer base during the COVID-19 pandemic, manual order tracking became inefficient and error-prone. This system automates the processes of:
- Book ordering
- Customer data management
- Sales tracking
- Invoice generation

## ❗ Problem Statement

The existing manual system caused:
- Inefficient order tracking
- Mismanagement of customer data
- Delays in checking book availability
- Frequent sales miscalculations

This led to poor customer service and posed risks to the company’s reputation and revenue.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Store customer and sales data systematically
- Track book availability and sales efficiently
- Improve overall staff workflow
- Provide a reliable and user-friendly online order system
